					<h2>Health</h2>
					<p>
					English Setters are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all Setters will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this breed.

					If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents. Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Setters, you should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).

					<h2>Feeding</h2>
					<p>
					Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.

					NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.
